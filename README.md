## Welcome to the Sea Serpent project!

Sea Serpent will eventually be a Python 2 and 3 toolkit for creating Kubernetes deployment files and Helm charts from Python code. 

The goal is to be able to create Kubernetes deployments using simple Python scripts and then to generate whatever format is needed for using a common deployment tool.
